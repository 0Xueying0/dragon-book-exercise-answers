# Exercises for Section 8.4

### 8.4.1

Figure 8.10 is a simple matrix-multiplication program.

1. Translate the program into three-address statements of the type we have been using in this section. Assume the matrix entries are numbers that require 8 bytes, and that matrices are stored in row-major order.
2. Construct the flow graph for your code from (a).
3. Identify the loops in your flow graph from (b).

```
for (i=O; i<n; i++)
    for (j=O; j<n; j++)
        c[i][j] = 0.0;
for (i=O; i<n; i++)
    for (j=O; j<n; j++)
        for (k=O; k<n; k++)
            ï¿¼c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];
```

### 8.4.2

Figure 8.11 is code to count the number of primes from 2 to n, using the sieve method on a suitably large array a. That is, a[i] is TRUE at the end only if there is no prime i^0.5 or less that evenly divides i. We initialize all a[i] to TRUE and then set a[j] to FALSE if we find a divisor of j.

1. Translate the program into three-address statements of the type we have been using in this section. Assume integers require 4 bytes.
2. Construct the flow graph for your code from (a).
3. Identify the loops in your flow graph from (b).

```
for (i=2; i<=n; i++)
    a[i] = TRUE;
count = 0;
s = sqrt(n);
for (i=2; i<=s; i++)
if (a[i]) 1* i has been found to be a prime *1 {
    count++ ;
    for (j=2*i; j<=n; j = j+i)
        a[j] = FALSE; 1* no multiple of i is a prime *1
    }
```
