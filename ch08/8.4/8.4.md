# Exercises for Section 8.4

### 8.4.1

Figure 8.10 is a simple matrix-multiplication program.

1. Translate the program into three-address statements of the type we have been using in this section. Assume the matrix entries are numbers that require 8 bytes, and that matrices are stored in row-major order.
2. Construct the flow graph for your code from (a).
3. Identify the loops in your flow graph from (b).

```
for (i=O; i<n; i++)
    for (j=O; j<n; j++)
        c[i][j] = 0.0;
for (i=O; i<n; i++)
    for (j=O; j<n; j++)
        for (k=O; k<n; k++)
            ￼c[i][j] = c[i][j] + a[i][k]*b[k][j];
```

#### answer

1. three-address statements

    ```
     1)  i = 0

     2)  j = 0

     3)  t1 = n * i
     4)  t2 = t1 + j
     5)  t3 = t2 * 8
     6)  c[t3] = 0.0
     7)  j = j + 1
     8)  if j < n goto (3)

     9)  i = i + 1
    10)  if i < n goto (2)

    11)  i = 0

    12)  j = 0

    13)  k = 0

    14)  t4 = n * i
    15)  t5 = t4 + j
    16)  t6 = t5 * 8
    17)  t7 = c[t6]
    18)  t8 = n * i
    19)  t9 = t8 + k
    20)  t10 = t9 * 8
    21)  t11 = a[t10]
    22)  t12 = n * k
    23)  t13 = t12 + j
    24)  t14 = t13 * 8
    25)  t15 = b[t14]
    26)  t16 = t11 * t15
    27)  t17 = t7 + t16
    28)  c[t6] = t17
    29)  k = k + 1
    30)  if k < n goto (14)

    31)  j = j + 1
    32)  if j < n goto (13)

    33)  i = i + 1
    34)  if i < n goto (12)
    ```

2个疑问（集中在 14~28 行代码）：

1. 这段代码是否使用了正确的处理顺序？
2. 第 17 行代码，直接根据 16 行计算得到的偏移量得到了 c[i][j] 的值，省略了重新计算偏移量，是否正确？

### 8.4.2

Figure 8.11 is code to count the number of primes from 2 to n, using the sieve method on a suitably large array a. That is, a[i] is TRUE at the end only if there is no prime i^0.5 or less that evenly divides i. We initialize all a[i] to TRUE and then set a[j] to FALSE if we find a divisor of j.

1. Translate the program into three-address statements of the type we have been using in this section. Assume integers require 4 bytes.
2. Construct the flow graph for your code from (a).
3. Identify the loops in your flow graph from (b).

```
for (i=2; i<=n; i++)
    a[i] = TRUE;
count = 0;
s = sqrt(n);
for (i=2; i<=s; i++)
if (a[i]) 1* i has been found to be a prime *1 {
    count++ ;
    for (j=2*i; j<=n; j = j+i)
        a[j] = FALSE; 1* no multiple of i is a prime *1
    }
```
