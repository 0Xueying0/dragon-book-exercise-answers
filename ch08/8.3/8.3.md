# Exercises for Section 8.3

### 8.3.1

Generate code for the following three-address statements as­ suming stack allocation where register SP points to the top of the stack.

```
call p
call q
return
call r
return
return
```

### 8.3.2

Generate code for the following three-address statements as­ suming stack allocation where register SP points to the top of the stack.

1. x = 1
2. x=a
3. x = a + 1
4. x = a+b
5. The two statements
    - x = b * c
    - y = a + x

### 8.3.3

Generate code for the following three-address statements again assuming stack allocation and assuming a and b are arrays whose ele­ ments are 4-byte values.

1. The four-statement sequence

    ```
    x = a[i]
    y = b[j]
    a[i] = y
    b[j] = x
    ```
2. The three-statement sequence

    ```
    x = a[i]
    y = b[i]
    z = x * y
    ```

3. The three-statement sequence

    ```
    x = a[i]
    y = b[x]
    a[i] = y
    ```
